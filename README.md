Hello!<br>
This is about <b>extention for Qlik Sense</b>, for UI|UX elements like a <b>horizontal menu</b> for navigations (http and pages of current app).

Original repo of menu_sistel is there: https://github.com/JordiFerrerB/sistel_menu_extension

Here is a clone of one of original versions with some <b>css injections</b>.
It was done quickly, may have errors or troubles... If you want use it, so use it as is, without any "garanty or warranty" or any other obligations|regulations.
<br><br>
Anyway, my task was solved quickly and it works in my environment without errors.
<br><br>
Thank you.
